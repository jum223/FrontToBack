        # Preface / Context

Throughout history, wars have had a profound impact on markets and economies. From World War I and World War II to the Gulf War and the Syrian Civil War, conflicts have resulted in significant economic disruptions, with markets reacting to the uncertainty and instability brought about by these events. In some cases, the impact has been short-lived, while in others, the effects have been long-lasting and far-reaching. For example, during World War II, the United States' entry into the conflict led to increased government spending on military production and created new job opportunities in the defense industry, which helped stimulate economic growth. In contrast, the Gulf War in the early 1990s led to a significant increase in oil prices due to concerns over supply disruptions, which caused a slowdown in economic activity.

In the case of the Russian-Ukraine conflict, the impact on markets has been complex and varied. The conflict has had a significant impact on energy markets, with oil and gas prices fluctuating due to concerns over supply disruptions and geopolitical tensions. Other affected markets have been the metals market given that Russia and Ukraine are key producers and sources of nickel, aluminum, titanium, iron, steel, and critical minerals. It is even estimated by 
The industry association UK Metallurg Prom and Oxford Economics that a third of the metal industry’s capacity has been destroyed and production is about 65% lower. The semiconductor industry has also been heavily affected due to supply chain issues and production shortages, stemming from the fact that Russia and Ukraine are major producers of neon and palladium, which are key materials needed to manufacture semiconductors. The transport industry has also been heavily affected, with many industrial ports, airports, and other transportation centers in the area being closed due to the war hazards, reduced tourism could also have a negative effect on the transport industry. The food industry also stands to lose from the war. Prior to the war Ukraine and Russia combined produced about one third of the world’s wheat demand, and they are also important sources of fertilizer, cooking oil and feed grains such as corn. 

Given the importance of markets and their impact on global economies, it is crucial to understand how conflicts such as the Russian-Ukraine conflict affect them. By analyzing the impact of the conflict on various sectors, we can gain valuable insights into the ways in which geopolitical events shape economic activity and help policymakers develop strategies to mitigate the effects of these events on markets.

# Introduction

The main objective of this project is to determine the extent to which reported key event dates in the Russo-Ukrainian war affected the returns for major firms in the energy, food, transport, semiconductors and metal industries from the start of the conflict until today. The use of visualizations and the calculation of the cumulative returns 20 days before and after a reported key event would serve to support the main hypothesis and answer the research question at hand.  

# Initial Hypothesis

We initially hypothesized that energy and metal industries would be most affected by the Russia-Ukraine War because of how significant these nations are in contributing to the production of these goods. Both nations are considered heavy players in global markets for the production of nickel, aluminum, titanium, iron, steel, and critical minerals. The conflict has also disrupted supply chains and has led to Europe’s efforts to reduce reliance on Russian energy. The price of fuel and energy within the European Union has also risen as Russia decided to suspend gas deliveries to several European Union countries, further impacting the situation. For these reasons, we believe that as the Russia-Ukraine conflict continues, these industries will face the greatest volatility and change.

# Data

The data that was used for this project included key event dates of the war, list of firms in the largest traded exchange-traded funds (ETF) for each industry, adjusted close stock prices for all the firms in the previously mentioned list, and the S&P 500 adjusted close prices for the specific time period. 

The key event dates were collected from CNN’s interactive Russo-Ukrainian war archive which outlined key events throughout the war. We collected 17 key event dates for the war. The data was manually written out. Web scraping was a possibility however due to the very limited amount of dates, it would be best to manually write out all 17 key dates rather than deploying some sort of a web scraping algorithm. In addition, it was more efficient to write them out and less hassle to deal with the html code which wrote all dates as strings and not in a date format. 

Next the S&P 500 adjusted close prices were downloaded through the use of ```yf.download``` function in Python. The selected dates were from 2/12/2022 through 4/10/2023. It was best to download this range of dates due to the fact that there is a start to the war and the end to the key event dates on the CNN website. However there were more prices downloaded due to the analysis that would be conducted in this report. The analysis consisted of  looking at  10 dates before and after an event, which required more dates and prices to be downloaded. 

The energy industry firm stocks that were downloaded were from the Vanguard Energy Index Fund ETF (VDE). The file that was downloaded was a CSV file, containing a list of firms that are part of this ETF. It had a total of 112 observations, these firms traded their shares in the U.S stock market and are also tracked by Yahoo Finance. The firms ranged from coal & consumable fuels, integrated oil & gas, oil & gas drilling, oil & gas equipment & services, oil & gas exploration & production, oil & gas exploration & marketing, and oil & gas storage & transportation.

The food industry firm stocks that were downloaded were from the First Trust Nasdaq Food & Beverage ETF (FTXG). It was a CSV file that contained a list of 30 observations, these firms were found to trade in the U.S stock market and also tracked by Yahoo Finance. The firms found in this ETF ranged from food products, soft drinks, fruit and grain processing, distillers and vintners, farming, fishing, ranching, and plantations. 

The transportation industry firm stocks that were downloaded came from the SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN). It was a CSV file that contained a list of 47 observations. The firms in this ETF operated in cargo ground transportation, passenger airlines, air freight & logistics, marine, passenger ground transportation, rail transportation, and trucking. All the firms in this list were tracked by Yahoo Finance. 

The semiconductor industry firm stocks that were downloaded came from SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (XSD). It was recorded in a CSV file that contained a list of 38 observations. The firms in this ETF operated specifically in the semiconductor industry, including firms such as NVIDIA, Micron Technology, Intel Corporation, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and many more. All of these companies trade in the U.S stock market and were also tracked by Yahoo Finance. 

The metal industry firm stocks were downloaded from a list of steel and iron ore focused firms. The downloaded CSV file contained 17 observations, mostly firms located in the U.S, such as Allegheny Technologies Incorporated, Carpenter Technology Corporation, Commercial Metals Company, etc. All of these stocks traded in the U.S stock market and were also tracked by Yahoo Finance.

After downloading the data for the different ETFs we accessed the column which identified the firms by their ticker and converted them to a list. This list of firms is what we then passed to the ````yfinance.download``` function which downloaded the pricing data for the firms of interest within the date range we specified. 

# Methodology

### Calculating Daily Returns for each Industry

After the initial download of the firm’s adjusted closing price by date, the first step was to calculate daily returns for each firm in the industries. This would then allow for the calculation of the excess and cumulative returns. 

We used the following code:

```python
metal_prices = metal_prices.sort_values(['Firm', 'Date'])
metal_prices['Daily Returns'] = metal_prices.groupby('Firm')['Adj Close'].pct_change()
```

The above code snippet is an example of how we calculated the daily returns of the firms in the metal industry, one can assume that this same algorithm was used for the rest of the industries. The use of a .groupby function separated the dataset between firms, which would not allow for firms to merge its returns and kept calculating daily returns within each individual firm. The use of the ```.pct_change()``` function is what calculates the daily return for the adjusted close (adjusted closing price) variable which is performed by taking the difference (expressed as a percentage) between the adjusted closing price of a firm in a given trading day and the adjusted closing price of a firm the next trading day. This was done for all five industries.

### Calculating Daily Returns for S&P 500

```python
market_ret.columns = ['Firm','Date','Adj Close']
market_ret['Firm'] = "sp500"
market_ret['Daily Returns'] = market_ret['Adj Close'].pct_change()
market_ret
```

This code calculated the daily returns for the S&P 500, which would come to serve as the market return which would then be compared to the different industry returns. The need to calculate the daily returns is to directly compare them to the firms’ daily returns from the metal, food, transportation, semiconductor, and energy industries, which would allow for the calculation of the excess returns. 

### Calculating Excess Returns

```python
metal_excess_returns = metal_prices.groupby(['Firm', 'Date'])['Daily Returns'].mean() - market_ret.set_index('Date')['Daily Returns']
metal_excess_returns = metal_excess_returns.reset_index()
metal_excess_returns = metal_excess_returns.rename(columns={'Daily Returns': 'Excess Returns'})
metal_excess_returns["Industry"] = "Metal"
```
The code above calculates the excess returns for the firms in the metal industry. It uses the daily returns from the firms in the metal industry and subtracts it to the S&P 500 daily returns. A positive excess return would demonstrate that a firm in the metal industry outperformed the S&P 500, and any negative excess value would show that the S&P 500 index outperformed a firm in the metal industry. This was repeated for all five industries in order to calculate their excess returns. We then added an extra column to specify which industry the given first belongs to. This final step is performed in preparation of the cumulative returns over different time frames by industry. 

### Calculating Cumulative Returns

```python
event_ret_df = pd.DataFrame()
industries = ['Food', 'Transport', 'Semiconductor', 'Energy', 'Metal']
for index, row in event_dates.iterrows():
    event = row['Event']
    date = row['Date']
    # Define the start and end dates for the subset
    start_date = pd.to_datetime(date) - pd.Timedelta(days=20)
    end_date = pd.to_datetime(date) + pd.Timedelta(days=20)

    for industry in industries:
        sub_df = inter_df.query("Date >= @start_date and Date <= @end_date and Industry == @industry")
        sub_df_cum = sub_df.assign(R=1+sub_df['Excess Returns']).assign(cumret=lambda x: x.groupby(['Firm'])['R'].cumprod()).groupby(['Date'])['cumret'].mean().reset_index(name='Cum_ret')
        sub_df_cum["Event"] = event
        sub_df_cum["EventDate"] = date
        sub_df_cum["Industry"] = industry
        event_ret_df = pd.concat([event_ret_df, sub_df_cum])

event_ret_df["Cum_ret"] = event_ret_df["Cum_ret"] - 1
event_ret_df["EventDate"] = pd.to_datetime(event_ret_df["EventDate"])
event_ret_df["Date"] = pd.to_datetime(event_ret_df["Date"])
event_ret_df.to_csv("../OutputData/final.csv")
```

This code essentially calculates cumulative returns by date for every industry for every major event in the war. The outer for-loop iterates over the major events dataframe, it then specifies a time frame for which cumulative returns are to be calculated, in our case we use 20 days before and after the event as we thought that this time frame would allow for a visual comparison of returns pre and post the events. 

The code then subsets the data to include only the rows that are within the time range and belonging to a certain industry, there is an inner for loop which iterates over the different values in the “Industry” column which allows for the calculation of cumulative returns by industry by event.

The resulting computed values, along with some other variable identifiers like the day of the event, the industry, and the nature of the event are then added into a dataframe which was created empty. The resulting dataframe is our final dataset which will be then used to produce the different visualizations seen in the “Home” tab of the dashboard. 

# The Final Dataset

In our final dataset every observation represents a calculation of a cumulative return for a specific industry for a specific event, which would allow us to plot cumulative returns by industry by events. Please note that the industries’ returns are cumulated separately for each event to allow for a better understanding and analysis of how events impact industry stock returns. This dataset contains a total of 2405 observations and 5 different columns, which are 'Date', 'Cum_ret', 'Event', 'EventDate', 'Industry'. If you have followed the steps to run the code in the readme file of the repo (link available in the home tab of the dashboard), you can inspect the nature of the dataset created which is called final.csv and is found within the OutputData folder.

    sub_df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(sub_df['Date'])
    last_date = sub_df['Date'].max()

        industry_df = sub_df[sub_df['Industry'] == industry]
        sns.lineplot(x='Date', y='Cum_ret', data=industry_df, label=industry)
    
    plt.axvline(date, color='red', linestyle='--', label='Event Date')
    plt.axvline(date1, color='red', linestyle='--', label='Event Date + 3')
    plt.axvline(date2, color='red', linestyle='--', label='Event Date + 10')
    plt.xlim(date - pd.Timedelta(days=20), date + pd.Timedelta(days=20))
    
    for line in plt.gca().lines:
        if line.get_label() in industries: 
            x = mpl_dates.date2num(date)
            x1 = mpl_dates.date2num(date1)
            x2 = mpl_dates.date2num(date2)
            y = np.interp(x, line.get_xdata().astype(np.float64), line.get_ydata().astype(np.float64))
            y1 = np.interp(x1, line.get_xdata().astype(np.float64), line.get_ydata().astype(np.float64))
            y2 = np.interp(x2, line.get_xdata().astype(np.float64), line.get_ydata().astype(np.float64))
            result = {"Date": date, "Industry": line.get_label(), 'ret0': y, "ret3": y1, "ret10": y2}
            rets.append(result)
    
    plt.close()

rets_df = pd.DataFrame(rets)
```
```python
rets_df["retDiff3"] = rets_df["ret3"] - rets_df["ret0"]
rets_df["retDiff10"] = rets_df["ret10"] - rets_df["ret0"]
rets_df = rets_df.drop(['ret3', 'ret10','ret0'], axis=1)
rets_df.rename(columns = {"retDiff3": "ret3", "retDiff10": "ret10"}, inplace = True)
rets_df.to_csv("../OutputData/RetDiff.csv")
rets_df.head(10)
```
The above code blocks are used to calculate return differences between the event date and some days after the event. We decided to calculate return differences 3 days after the event to allow for a numerical comparison and look at the short term effects of the event. We also wanted to look at return differences 10 days after the event, this allows for a numerical comparison within a longer time frame and could help us gain further insights into whether the effects of an event in the war are long lived or not. Even though the first code block might seem confusing, it is essentially accessing the return variable at times 0, 3 days after and 10 days after the event. Rather than using data points from our dataset to calculate the return differences we used the return values from the line graph, this solved one of the main limitations of our data, the fact that many dates are not actual trading days, meaning that in some cases we did not have a datapoint for a return on a given date. This also means that some return difference calculations are approximations, they are based on a point in the line graph which might be within two data points. For example if 3 days after the event, the day is a non-trading day, we don’t have return data for that date so instead we use the value displayed by the line graph.    

The second code block just serves to calculate return differences between the return values at different point in times which were accessed above. This was a complimentary dataset that we wanted to use for our analysis. We thought that mere line graph visualizations, could explain a general picture and trends but we also thought that we needed to have concrete numerical values which would allow for faster comparison between industries.  

# Creating our Dashboard

Our dashboard was created using the streamlit package. We organized the dashboard into two parts, the main window and the sidebar. From the sidebar the user can access the home page as well as the report. The sidebar also allows the user to select which industry and event they would like to see graphed. The main homepage features a graph created by the industry and event selected. The homepage also features a description of the event that was obtained from the CNN interactive timeline article, as well as our analysis of each industry at the time the event occurred. 

# Conclusion
In our analysis of the industry returns for Metal, Transport, Energy, Semiconductors, and Food, we observed that the Metal and Energy sectors were significantly impacted in the early days of the Russia-Ukraine conflict due to the nations' substantial contributions to the production of these goods. However, as the conflict progressed and major events unfolded, we did not notice any considerable changes in the other industry returns.

Despite our initial hypothesis, the observed impact on various industries during the conflict was not as significant as anticipated. To draw more accurate conclusions, further data analysis and consideration of other factors affecting the stock market, such as the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, may be necessary.
