Substract 1 from the cumulative returns dataset
Run the code that creates the cumulative return variable at t+3, t+10 and t+20
Keep improving graphs: maybe add individual firm line graphs
Maybe look at cumulative return (t+3, t+10 and t+20) between the different industries
Merge the datasets and possibly optimize the code
